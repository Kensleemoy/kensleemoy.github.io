## Welcome to My Page!

I was not entirely sure what should go here, so things might seem a bit random.

### Main Goal

My main goal is to get a better feel for _markdown_ language. 
I have worked with some markdown before, but it was a little different than the **.md** files, but they are still similar. 

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Kensleemoy/kensleemoy.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
